# -Portfolio-Risk-Assessment-1-Day-95-VaR-Calculation
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn), Yahoo Finance API, Scipy
ðŸ“Œ Project Highlights:
My project focused on assessing the risk of a diversified stock portfolio using historical data from major tech giants: Apple, Microsoft, Google, and Amazon.

âœ… Key Deliverables:

Collected and cleaned real stock market data from 2020 onwards (Yahoo Finance).

Constructed an equally weighted portfolio (25% per stock) to optimize risk diversification.

Calculated daily logarithmic returns to ensure accurate and stable risk analysis.

Applied statistical techniques to assess mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis of returns.

Implemented a 1-Day 95% Value at Risk (VaR) model to quantify maximum expected daily loss.

Found that the portfolio is unlikely to lose more than 2.9% to 3.1% of its value on most days.

ðŸ“ˆ Tools Used:
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn), Yahoo Finance API, Scipy

ðŸ’¡ What I Learned:

Practical use of VaR in financial risk management

Importance of data consistency and preprocessing

The power of diversification in reducing portfolio risk
